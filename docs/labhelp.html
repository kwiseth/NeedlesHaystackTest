<a href="com/alamedatechlab/googtest/NeedlesHaystackTest.html">NeedlesHaystackTest</a> is a Java console application that finds words in a local plaintext file.
You can enter up to 5 words to find in the plaintext file you specify.</p>
<p>The words you search for are called <b>needles</b>, and the plaintext file comprises the <b>haystack</b> in which to search.</p>
<p>
Download the compiled <a href="http://alameda-tech-lab.com/csprojects/2019/NeedlesHaystackTest"> NeedlesHaystackTest.class</a> file or download the java source and compile on your own system. The code was written and compiled using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html">Java SE (Oracle JDK) 11</a>. </p>


<p>Before running the application:</p>
  <ul><li>Identify the location of the plaintext file that you want to
  search, or place it in the same directory as the NeedlesHaystackTest class.
   You will need to enter the full path when prompted by the application.</li>
   <li>Pick some words that you want to find in the text file, and be prepared to
     enter them when prompted.</li></ul>

<h3>Running the Application</h3>
<p>To run the application:</p>
<code>java com.alamedatechlab.googtest.NeedlesHaystackTest</code>

<p>The application prompts you to enter the number of words that you want to find in
  the haystack, the name fo the file to search, and the words themselves. Respond
  to the prompts with your choices:

  <ol><li>Enter 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5</li>
    <li>Enter each word that you want to find</li>
    <li>Enter the filename that comprises the text of your <i>haystack</i>. Specify
      the full path to the file in the context of your system and its classpath. </li></ol>

<p>Entries are validated before proceeding,
    and an array of the specified size is created.</p>

    <h3>Processing Summary</h3>

    <p>The <code>haystack</code> is split into an array of individual <code>words</code> using
      a regular expression identifying quotation marks, apostrophe, tab, newline,
      form feed, and return characters and creating word tokens from the isolated substrings.</p>
<p>The length of the haystack array is then used to drive the comparison of each specified
    needle to each <code>word</code> in the haystack array.</p>

    <p>A counter keeps track of the number of instances of each word found in the haystack
      array.</p>

      <p>After all specified words are processed by the loop, each word and its total is
        printed at the console.</p>
